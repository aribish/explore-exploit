# explore-exploit
I determine the best explore/explot algorithm to use to store my belongings in the morning

## Background
I've recently been getting very involved in programming, and have been reading _Algorithms to Live By_ by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths.
I've been implementing the algorithms described in each chapter as I read. Recently, I've been having trouble deciding where to store my
belongings in my school in the morning, so I decided to use my newfound interest in algorithms to solve this problem. This project spits
out the results of several explore/exploit algorithms that try to get the most value using several locations.

The locations in question are as follows:
* Locker: While I can store the most belongings here, the lock is inconsistent
* Band Room: This option is very reliable, but I can't store as many items here
* Teacher's Room: This option is a middle ground: its consistency is moderate, and I can store a couple belongings here

Despite its small size, making this project has proven to be very educational for me. I figured out how to implement several algorithms 
and solved (kinda) a real world problem for my self. This is also my first time writing something in the Go programming language, which
I love so far, especially coming from a C background.

## How to Run
The Go compiler must be installed to run this project. Once installed, simple run the command `go run mabproblem.go` No makefiles or headers in Go :)
